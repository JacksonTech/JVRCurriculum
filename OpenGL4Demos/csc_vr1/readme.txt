The program has been tested on an OpenGL 4.0 Intel HD Graphics card (my tablet),
my OpenGL 4.4 nVidia GeForce 650TI, and the nVidia lab machines (specifically,
the instructor's machine and several of the back wall machines). It works on
my AMD machine at home (OpenGL 4.3, AMD HD Graphics 6950) but I did NOT have 
time to test it at the lab AMD machines. :( However, I see no reason why it
would not work.

Scrolling the mouse wheel up/down changes the triangle speed. Pressing the 
Background Color button toggles between a solid color and "disco mode". 
(It was originally a faster color fade but I didn't want to give anyone
a seizure.)
